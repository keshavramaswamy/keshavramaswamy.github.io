          <p>I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, Gainesville. I am passionate about Data Science and everyday I find some reason to get excited by its pervasive use in almost any domain. Is there at all any area where one can't apply Data Science to it? I am eager to make a tangible impact on the world by developing Data Science products. <br> Also, I am a strong advocate of the role of open-source in aiding future technology. I open-source my projects and look to contribute to other open source projects as well . </p>

          <p class="dataxu-description">It was fun learning the basics of <b>Linear Optimization</b> - especially about infeasiblity in linear programs. <b>Python</b> was the primary programming language I used during the development phase. I enjoyed using <b>IPython Notebooks</b> for any supporting analysis. <b>Ansible</b> was one cool open-source software I got to work while automating the tool. Amazon Web Services like <b>S3</b>, <b>DataPipelines</b>, <b>EC2</b> etc. and CI services like <b>Jenkins</b> was amongst the other technologies I learnt and enjoyed using.</p>

The project I worked on aimed to assist patients by predicting their congnitive distortions from the patients' personal text data. <br> I helped to develop a sentiment classifier to classify text containing the cognitive distortions into various categories such as 'black and white', 'all-or-nothing' , 'overgeneralisation' etc.  Training imbalanced datasets and working with out-of-domain sentiment analysis were some of the aspects I enjoyed working.</p>
